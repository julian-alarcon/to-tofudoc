# To OpenTofu Docs

This is a Browser extension (Firefox and Chrome supported).

It's a simple extension that takes the pages from a Hashicorp Terraform
documentation and redirects the page to OpenTofu.

Currently it shows a confirmation dialog before for each page redirection.

It's using Manifest V3, so compatibility should have no issues with close to
happen support changes.

## TODO

* Support toggle preference to always redirect without confirming.
